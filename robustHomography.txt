Initialization
---------------
- Let t = threshold

- Let p = probability that we choose an inlier
	then, p = (n - n')/ n
	
- probability that we choose 4 inliers = p^4

- probability at least one outlier is chosen = 1 - p^4

- probability of failure = (1 - p^4)^N

- probability of success, p_s = 1 - (1 - p^4)^N

=> N = log(1 - p_s)/log(1 - p^4)


Algorithm
---------

Repeat N times

	- randomly pick 4 pairs of correspondences {p_r, q_r} from c_k
	- compute homography H using {p_r, q_r}
	- compute error between H * p_r and q_r
	- if error <= t, exit loop
	
return H
