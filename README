panorama generation instructions
--------------------------------

- call pickcorrespondences to select common points between images

- point selection is as follows
	- select 4 corresponding points on each pair of images in the 
	  following order, bottom left, bottom right, top right and top left
	- complete point selection on one image before moving on to the next
	  ie do not select a point on image n and move on to select the
	  corresponding point on image n+1, instead select all four points on
	  image n, then, select the four corresponding points on image n + 1
	  
- you may now call makepanorama with the point storage file you supplied as an
  argument to pickcorrespondences
  
- make sure there is no final forward slash in the directory argument ie
  arguments such as "seq1/" will produce an error instead use
  "seq1"
